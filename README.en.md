# Apple WLOC Location Spoofer

Modify the coordinates returned by Apple's network-based location service (WiFi/cell) to spoof iOS network location. Open the online picker page, choose a spot, and it takes effect — no need to type latitude/longitude by hand.

## Shortcuts (recommended, most convenient)

Switch / clear the location straight from the Shortcuts app, without opening the picker page:

- **wloc Set Location**: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/182f3a014597468eb1b15b99261cdf22
- **wloc Clear & Restore Location**: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0352d53ed79849d382f50e9adf050662

**Usage**

- **Set location:** pick a spot in a Maps app (long-press the map to drop a pin) → Share → choose "wloc Set Location" to switch.
  - Apple Maps: pick a spot → Share → "wloc Set Location"
  - Amap: pick a spot → Share → **More** → "wloc Set Location"
- **Clear location:** tap "wloc Clear & Restore Location" to restore your real location.

Supports Apple Maps and Amap (including short links, with automatic redirect following + GCJ-02→WGS84 coordinate conversion).

> Prerequisites: proxy on + module enabled + `gs-loc.apple.com` trusted. The picker page (Worker / Pages) approach is still available; see below.

### About map link parsing (worker)

To make Apple Maps and Amap go through the same flow, links are sent to `wloc-spoofer.cyberhandyman.workers.dev/api/parse` for parsing:

- **Amap**: shares produce a short link, and the real coordinates are hidden only in the `Location` header of the 302 redirect — and they are GCJ-02 offset coordinates. A Shortcut can neither read the redirect header nor easily do the coordinate conversion, so the worker follows the redirect → extracts the coordinates → converts GCJ-02→WGS84 → returns latitude/longitude.
- **Apple Maps**: the link carries `coordinate=lat,lon` directly, but **in mainland China these are also GCJ-02 offset coordinates**, so like Amap the worker performs the GCJ-02→WGS84 conversion before returning them; coordinates outside China skip the conversion automatically (`out_of_china` check) and are returned as-is. Beyond unifying the coordinate system, using the same endpoint also makes it easier to handle short links, links embedded in text, name decoding, and so on uniformly.

**Privacy:** `/api/parse` is a pure forward-and-parse endpoint — it receives a link → follows redirects → parses the coordinates → returns JSON, without writing any storage, logging, or caching anything; everything is discarded once done.

**Deploy your own if you're concerned:** the worker source is fully open source and you can deploy your own copy to replace the address above:

- Parsing logic: [`worker/src/parse.js`](worker/src/parse.js), routing: [`worker/src/index.js`](worker/src/index.js)
- After deploying, replace `wloc-spoofer.cyberhandyman.workers.dev` in the Shortcut with your own worker domain.

<summary><b>How to use</b></summary>

1. Subscribe to the module and enable MITM
2. Open the online picker page (public Worker; adding it to the Home Screen is recommended)
3. Pick a location on the map / search a place name / paste a map link
4. Tap "Save to Device"
5. It takes effect automatically the next time Apple location is triggered

Supports parsing Apple Maps / Google Maps / Amap / Baidu / coordinate text links.

> **Note for iOS 26/27 and later:** starting with iOS 26, Apple significantly strengthened `locationd`'s location cache. The system keeps previously obtained real location results in memory and reuses them for a long time. This means that after installing the module or switching the target coordinates, even if the script has successfully modified the WLOC response (the log shows "patched"), the system may keep using the old cached coordinates, so the location appears not to change.
>
> **Fix: restart the device.** A restart clears `locationd`'s in-memory cache, and the system will get the modified coordinates when it makes a new WLOC request. Toggling Airplane Mode, turning off Location Services, and similar tricks **cannot** clear this cache on iOS 26+; a restart is required. iOS 15–18 usually take effect without a restart.

**Recommended procedure for newer systems (highest success rate):**

Method 1:
1. First pick the location you want on the picker page and save it to the device
2. Turn on Airplane Mode → turn off Location Services → restart the device
3. Turn off Airplane Mode (turn off WiFi too) → connect the proxy tool (confirm the VPN icon appears) → turn on Location Services
4. Open Maps to verify

Method 2:
1. Turn off Location Services
2. Pick a location on the picker page and save it to the device
3. Turn on Location Services → when "Allow Once / Ask Next Time" appears, choose **"Ask Next Time Or When I Share"**
4. Open Maps to verify

<summary><b>How it works</b></summary>

```
picker page → fetch gs-loc.apple.com/wloc-settings/save?lon=x&lat=y
            → proxy module intercepts → wloc-settings.js writes to $persistentStore
            → next WLOC trigger → wloc.js reads coordinates → patches the protobuf response
```

The module contains two rules:
- `wloc.js` — intercepts the `/clls/wloc` response, parses the protobuf and replaces the coordinates
- `wloc-settings.js` — intercepts the `/wloc-settings/save` request and writes to persistent storage

<summary><b>Parameters</b></summary>

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|------|------|--------|
| longitude | Target longitude (online picker takes priority) | null (passthrough) |
| latitude | Target latitude (online picker takes priority) | null (passthrough) |
| accuracy | Accuracy (meters) | 25 |
| logLevel | Log level | info |

Priority: online picker save > module parameters > default value

<summary><b>Disable spoofing / restore real location</b></summary>

**Method 1: turn off or delete the module** (recommended)

Once the module is off, the script no longer intercepts WLOC requests and the system restores the real location automatically. iOS 26+ requires a device restart to clear the location cache.

**Method 2: clear the persisted data (passthrough mode)**

After clearing the saved coordinates, the script enters **passthrough mode** — it does not modify the WLOC response and lets the original data through, so the system restores the real GPS location automatically.

**Passthrough mode trigger condition:** when the persisted data is empty (null) and the module parameters are the defaults (113.94114, 22.544577), the script decides the user has not set custom coordinates and skips modification automatically. There is no need to change the module's default parameters; simply clearing the persisted data triggers passthrough.

Delete the persisted data in your proxy tool; the field name is `wloc_settings`:

- **Surge** — run in the script editor: `$persistentStore.write(null, "wloc_settings")`
- **Quantumult X** — run: `$prefs.removeValueForKey("wloc_settings")`
- **Loon** — run: `$persistentStore.write(null, "wloc_settings")`

After clearing, restart the device to restore the real location. There is no need to turn off the module; the script automatically detects that there are no custom coordinates and skips modification.

> **Note:** if the user manually changed the longitude/latitude in the module parameters (i.e. not the default 113.94114, 22.544577), the script will still use the coordinates from the module parameters even after clearing the persisted data. Only when the default parameters are kept unchanged does clearing the persisted data enter passthrough mode.

<details>
<summary><b>Favorites feature</b></summary>

The online picker page supports saving multiple locations as favorites, making it easy to switch back and forth:

- **Add a favorite**: after picking a location, tap "Add Favorite" → enter a label (Chinese/English/numbers supported, up to 30 characters) → save
- **Quick switch**: tap a location in the favorites list → the map jumps to it → tap "Save to Device" to switch
- **Active marker**: a favorite that matches the coordinates saved on the device shows "✓ Active now"
- **Manage/delete**: delete individually (× button) or clear all
- **Active coordinates**: the page shows the device-side persisted data (wloc_settings), with refresh-query and clear support

**Data storage notes:**
- **Favorites list** → stored in the browser's `localStorage` (used only for the picker page's UI convenience)
- **Active coordinates** → stored in the proxy tool's persistent storage `$persistentStore` (the data the script actually reads at runtime)

The two are stored independently. The favorites list is browser-side helper data; clearing the browser cache or switching browsers means you'll need to re-add favorites, but it does not affect the active coordinates already saved to the device.

<details>
<summary><b>Self-hosting the Worker (recommended)</b></summary>

The public picker page has a request limit, so deploying your own instance is recommended:

- **Workers**: `https://wloc-spoofer.cyberhandyman.workers.dev/`
- **Pages**: `https://<your-project-name>.pages.dev/`

**One-click deploy (Workers):**

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cyberhandyman/wloc-spoofer-en/tree/main/worker)

> One-click deploy only supports Workers mode; click the button and follow the prompts to authorize and finish the deployment.

**Manual deploy (Workers):**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cyberhandyman/wloc-spoofer-en.git
cd wloc-spoofer-en/worker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Log in to Cloudflare (first time only)
npx wrangler login

# 4. Deploy
npm run deploy
```

Once deployed you'll get your own Worker address (e.g. `https://wloc-spoofer.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`); use that address to pick locations.

> Free accounts get 100,000 requests per day, which is more than enough for personal use.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Pages deployment</summary>

Pages deployment does not support the one-click button and must be done manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberhandyman/wloc-spoofer-en.git
cd wloc-spoofer-en/worker
npm install
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <your-project-name>
```

During deployment you'll be prompted to set the production branch; enter `main`. Once deployed you'll get a `https://<project-name>.pages.dev` address.

Pages and Workers are functionally identical; choose whichever you prefer.

<summary><b>Notes</b></summary>

- Requires the MITM certificate to trust `gs-loc.apple.com` and `gs-loc-cn.apple.com`
- Only modifies network location (WiFi/cell); does not affect GPS hardware location
- iOS may ignore network location results when the GPS signal is strong
- Works best in indoor scenarios where WiFi-based location dominates
- The picker page must be used in proxy mode (Safari must go through the proxy to intercept the save request)
